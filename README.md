# Technical Challenge Tokenlab - Flutter Movie Rank App

This project is a prototype of an API REST that presents a list of the most popular 20 movies according to the available data at The Movie Database(TMDB) API. It was developed as part of a technical challenge for the Tokenlab company.

## details

This project was developed using flutter, an open source SDK, coupled with dart, a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform, and in a time span of one week. The code structure follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The prototype contemplates the main features necessary for the API, including fetching data from the web, saving and reading it locally, and displaying it through two different views.
